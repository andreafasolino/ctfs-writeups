COMANDI:
    snort -W    //see all workable interfaces
    snort -i 4 -v   //start snort on interface 4 of the list, without rules it just let you see the packets
    snort -i 4 -vd  //verbose with full dump of the packets
    snort -i 4 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -T    //-T test snort.conf file to make sure there are no errors
    snort -i 4 -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -l c:\Snort\log -K ascii



RULES:
    rules file : files .rule, every rule file may contain many rules
    specify folder containing rules in ($RULE_PATH ecc) <snort dir>/etc/snort.conf         //pay attention to version written on top of the file
    alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP test"; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:icmp-event;)

        Rule header = alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any
            alert = Rule action (generate an alert when the set condition is met)
            any = source ip
            any = source port
            -> = direction, source to destination
            $HOME_NET = destination ip (variable from the snort.conf file)
            any = destination port
        Rule options = (msg:"ICMP test"; sid:1000001; rev:1; classtype:icmp-event;)
            msg:"ICMP test" = message included in the alert by snort
            sid:1000001 = snort rule id, all numers < 1000000 are reserved,
            rev:1 = revision number (easier  rule maintenance)
            classtype:icmp-event = category of the rule, icmp-event is one of the predefined snort categories
    
    alert tcp 192.168.1.2 anu -> $HOME_NET 21  (msg:"FTP connection attempt"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)
    alert tcp $HOME_NET 21 -> any any (msg:"FTP failed login"; content:"Login or pwd incorrect"; sid:1000003; rev:1;)
